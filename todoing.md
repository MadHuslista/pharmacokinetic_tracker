# TODOING

# PRIORITY BECAUSE NEEDED
- Add a second axis, so I have both, the time and the delay 

# Library
- Create the independent libraries (branch feature/libraries): 
  - #	{ include = "pk_engine" },
  - #	{ include = "pk_db" },
  - #    { include = "pk_visuals"}

- Add them to the poetry file 

# Then reevaluate with what to continue. 
  - Basic DB enabling?
